Chess written in cpp using sfml library. 
To compile this code you need sfml libraries and preferably g++.
There is a bash script for compilation.
The window isn't scalable, if you resize the window the chess won't work corectly.
The code itself isn't documented and is not very well written.
You need to hold the piece to move it on different square.
I know that the code isn't very smooth and if you try really hard there are definitly some bugs and lot of lags, but the chess should work according to all chess rules.
All code was written by Ondřej Pupík.
